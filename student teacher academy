1)	Open eclipse = file new – project- enter the project name and finish.
2)	Create package and class as required for teacher student project.
3)	Create table for student teacher under mysql database.
4)	Under eclipse project – package- class.
5)	Create jdbc – driver management
6)	Create statement
7)	Execute statement
8)	Result set ( note _  I have made this as optional for the below project).
9)	Close connection
10)	Ensure that the jar file is added under build path mysql jar file must be downloaded from 
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/


Note: the port number is 3306 = The database name under eclipse is same as database name of Mysql.

The table name is also the same name as of MYsql.

Mysql – create database – use same database – create table classroom.

=============================

package studentsub;
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;


public class timetable {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
		Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/teacherstudent","root","Venkat@1973");
		Statement stmt=con.createStatement();
		String s="select * from classroom";
		stmt.execute(s);
		con.close();
		
	}

}

Note : ensure that the correct libruaries are added


Scrum master sprint planning. In two lines steps explained the task of project owner.

Going by the concept let say week one the database is created under my sql.
week two the jdbc connection is created under eclipse to display the table created.
